Web Portfolio

### Technologies used:
- JavaScript, CSS, HTML
- React JS
- Tailwind CSS


## Notes for building:

I will probably leave this part in after I am finished just for future reference.  You can ignore this part, I am just writing notes for development :)

### Requirements:
- The Landing Page.
  - This will likely be what goes on my resume.
  - Perhaps the domain would be something along the lines of "justinventura.tech"?  ~If I can get that domain.~ Got it :)
  - I will have a universal nav bar which will be more of a banner.
  - The landing page will ~have the text "I am..." then~ 4 buttons:
    1. ["Looking to hire Justin"](#curriculum-vitae) *Company Logos*
    2. ["Interested in Justin's music"](#zoom-music) *Apple Music Logo?*
    3. ["A student at Salisbury University"](#salisbury-university) *SU Logo*
    4. ["Here for the KinetiKZ Clan"](#kinetikz-clash) *Clash of Clans Logo*
- General Style:
  - Header:
    - Top left: `justin-ventura.py`
    - Follows as you scroll?  ~Maybe.~ *Yes, used React Sticky Nav*
  - Main colors: black, purple, orange, white.
  - Background should be black (or white, if I can figure out to change themes).
  - Footer:
    - `Justin Ventura 2023`
